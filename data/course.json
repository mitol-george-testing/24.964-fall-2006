  "course_description": "Many details of phonetic realization cannot be predicted from standard phonological representations on a language-independent basis, so phonetic realization must be specified in grammar. In this seminar we will investigate phonetic realization as a component of grammar.\n\nThe basic questions that we will address are:\n\n*   What is the form of the phonetic realization component?\n*   What is its relationship to phonology?\n",
